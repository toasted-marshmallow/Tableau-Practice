# Sales and Target Sales -- Sample Dual Axis Charts
This chart was created to show the aggregated sales by date and department/categories. The grey highlight are the departments' respective target sales and the chart below represent the how far below or above the department was.
This was good practice for creating calculated fields and blending data.

This data set was given to me in a course on Udemy called **Tableau 2020 A-Z: Hands-On Tableau Training for Data Science**.
