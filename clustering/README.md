# Clustering Sample
This dashboard was created using sample data and it contained data with regards to marketing and revenue. I have created clusters on the basis of population, marketing spend, and revenue, and created some charts for them.
We can see three distinct clusters on the scatter/trend-line plot, and the clusters are due respective populations.

This data set was given to me in a course on Udemy called **Tableau 2020 A-Z: Hands-On Tableau Training for Data Science**.
If you are interested in the Udemy course and the dataset, you can find them below:
