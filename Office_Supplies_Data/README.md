# Simple Bar Plot
I created a simple bar plot in Tableau using data given containing office supply sales by representative, geographic region, units, and unit price.
I then created a calculated field for the "total sales" column by multiplying units and unit price.

This data set was given to me in a course on Udemy called **Tableau 2020 A-Z: Hands-On Tableau Training for Data Science**.
If you are interested in the Udemy course and the dataset, you can find them below:
