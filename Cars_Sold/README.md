# Cars Sold by Year and Region -- Practicing Data Prepping in Excel and Tableau (pivots, etc)
This chart breaks down the number of cars sold by year and region. This exercise focused largely on the data prepping phase of "data science." I started off in Excel by creating rows/columns and removing comments. From there, I imported the Microsoft Excel file into Tableau where I then used the data interpreter feature. I then pivoted all of the year columns to form one long column for year, which is interpretable by the machine. This function is similar to the melt function in R. After the data cleaning phase, the chart is pretty straightforward to create.

This data set was given to me in a course on Udemy called **Tableau 2020 A-Z: Hands-On Tableau Training for Data Science**.
