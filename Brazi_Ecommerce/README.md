# Interactive Geographic Map - Brazilian Ecommmercce Data
This map was created using datasets containing Brazilian ecommerce data that can be found on Kaggle or at the links shown below. We have plotted sales by zip, state, long/lat, containing sales data.
The size of the circle shows the magnitude of sales and the colour just highlights the different states in Brazil. The main purpose of this exercise was to practice data modelling i.e., connecting several datasets together in a meaningful manner. 
This is rather easy to accomplish in Tableau via relationship functions.

This data set was given to me in a course on Udemy called **Tableau 2020 A-Z: Hands-On Tableau Training for Data Science**.
If you are interested in the Udemy course and the dataset, you can find them below:
