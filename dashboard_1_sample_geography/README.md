# Sample Dashboard 1: Sales and Profit Margin Choropleth and Scatterplot
I implemented an inner-join in order to combine two sheets in a Microsoft Excel file. These were to connect customer order IDs because the customer order IDs were not unique i.e., 
customers had more than one orders. I created a calculated field for the profit margin and used the colour scale to demonstrate the magnitude of the profit margin by country. 
The size of the circles represents the cumulative sales per country. There is also a filter by year as well.
